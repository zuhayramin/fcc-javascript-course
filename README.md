# fcc-javascript-course
A collection of all the javascript programs I wrote to pass the *FreeCodeCamp Javascript: Data Structures &amp; Algorithms* course.

This course was a great refresher on the js concepts I had covered while working on previous projects, and solidified the theory behind a lot of built-in functions
